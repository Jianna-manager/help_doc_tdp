# Reference Genome data

We used reference genome from HGNC database, with Ensembl ID as the primary key identifier. All data types ([disease-dependent data](disease-dependent-data/) and [disease-independent data](disease-independent-data/)) were aligned with the reference genome before ingested into the knowledge base. This alignment ensures consistency and compatibility across datasets, enabling accurate integration and analysis within the system.
