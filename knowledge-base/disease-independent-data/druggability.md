# Druggability

Druggability scores are derived directly from DrugnomeAI, it estimates the druggability likelihood for every protein-coding gene in the human exome [\[1\]](druggability.md#citation-1).

We use **{"Druggability"}\_{"Score"}\_{"drugnome"}\_{disease-agnostic/domain specific model}** as the format, for example, “Druggability\_Score\_drugnome\_small molecule”, shown as below:
